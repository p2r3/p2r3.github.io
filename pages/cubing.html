        Have you ever had one of those Rubik's cube puzzles? Unless you became randomly obsessed with it, chances are you've never actually solved one. And I'll tell you - after you've solved it once using algorithms from some YouTube video that you've written down on a torn piece of notebook paper, you start wondering if you can do it without looking at those random letters.<br><br>
        And after learning that, you start to see how it might get interesting to push the limits. To see how fast you can go. So you order a "speedcube" made specifically for that. And then it's no longer just a "Rubik's cube" toy. That's how it becomes a hobby. It's something so simple and casual, yet very competitive.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h1>How fast can you go?</h1>
      <div class="separator"></div>
      <p>
        Well, I never got into speedcubing as seriously as a lot of other cubers. My fastest attempts came down to barely under 40 seconds. For comparison, the world record is something around 3.4 seconds. It's not all about just going fast, though. At some point I just enjoyed collecting them. Different shapes and sizes, with varying difficulty, some not even cubes.<br><br>

      <h1>When did you start?</h1>
      <div class="separator"></div>
      <p>
        Once again, I'm not exactly sure. I remember the day I got my first cube, and the day I solved it. Just not the date, if that makes sense. It's probably around 4 years ago. I saw a <i>(fake)</i> video on YouTube of a guy solving it by just repeating a simple set of moves a few times. So, when that didn't work, I thought about actually learning how to solve it. And then I found this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/redkb" target="_blank">RedKB</a> guy, which is where the hype really took off. If you're planning on getting into cubing, I strongly suggest checking out his channel.<br><br>
