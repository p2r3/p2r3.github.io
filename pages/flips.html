        I don't remember exactly when I first got unlimited access to a trampoline, simply because I've had it for so long I can't remember a time without it.<br><br>
        I never set out a goal to learn a bunch of tricks or anything. I think having a trampoline in your backyard throughout my entire childhood eventually just got me curious, though.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h1>So, what can I do?</h1>
      <div class="separator"></div>
      <p>
        Obviously, I can do the basic frontflips, backflips, sideflips, etc. and variations of those.<br><br>
        The most impressive thing I've done, however, is a double frontflip. It's also the one with the lowest success rate. Well, mostly because the first few times I tried it I didn't fully commit to it and tried to stop mid-flip.<br><br>
        Something that I've yet to do even once is a double backflip. I'm just not confident enough... yet. That's also the only thing bugging me right now, since I can do most of all the other stuff.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h1>Why do I still do this?</h1>
      <div class="separator"></div>
      <p>
        The thing I enjoy most nowadays is experimenting with different combinations, setups and possibly even new tricks. The problem with that is that since me and my friends have been at it for so long, we rarely discover anything interesting.<br><br>
        Another reason is that I'm a huge showoff when it comes to things I'm sure I'm better at than anyone else. So if I practice enough, I can make sure I'm good enough to flex on the casuals. Narcissistic, I know. <br><br>
