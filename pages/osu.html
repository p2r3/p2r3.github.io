        osu! is a rhyth game about clicking circles to the beat of a song. Might not sound very complicated at first, and it really isn't, until you get to the higher difficulties. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/AYcc5FjUO7I?t=63" target="_blank">this video</a> if you don't know what I'm talking about.<br><br>
        Obviously, I'm not <i>that</i> good, but because of the addicting nature of this simple game, I've managed to stick around long enough to gain some amount of skill. Again, if you read the <a href="flips.html">flips page</a>, this is another one of those things that I can be certain I can impress others with.<br><br>

        At the time of writing, I'm around rank #50'000 globally. This might not seem much at first, but the ranks go down into seven digits. So, nothing spectacular, but definitely something that deserves a mention here. Here's a really old <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/481265951" target="_blank">video</a> of one of my scores for reference. Also, the lag is just my internet, not the game. I'm saying "not again" because of the stress.<br><br>
        I'm not exactly too proud of <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9587813" target="_blank">my account</a>, though. I have a very low average hit accuracy, and all of my highest performance plays are beatmaps that by the majority are considered simply easy ways to gain performance points.<br><br>
