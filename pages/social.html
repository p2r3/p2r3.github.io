      <h1>Why?</h1>
      <div class="separator"></div>
      <p>
        If you're not a very technical person when it comes to things on the internet, and you don't ever read the terms and conditions, chances are you've got no idea how companies like Google use your data.<br><br>
        Well, actually, neither do I. And lack of transparency is part of the problem. In short, these companies can take whatever they want from you and use it however they want. The barrier of privacy here is very blurred.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h1>So no social media?</h1>
      <div class="separator"></div>
      <p>
        Well, it's not like I don't have any presence on the internet. I have fairly active accounts on <a href="https://twitter.com/1portal2runner3" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://reddit.com/u/1portal2runner3" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/portalrunner" target="_blank">Twitch</a>. And nothing else. Not even a YouTube or Google account.<br><br>
        Actually, I'm not even sure if I want to keep that Twitter account. Twitter has some shady terms and conditions. Still, I've managed to avoid the biggest offenders like Facebook, Instagram, Google and I'm proud of that.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h1>Then what do you use?</h1>
      <div class="separator"></div>
      <p>
        There are alternatives to the most important tools. In terms of alternatives for Google there's <a href="https://duckduckgo.com" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> or <a href="https://startpage.com" target="_blank">StartPage</a>, both of which are privacy oriented.<br><br>
        If you want do dive even deeper, you could try replacing Windows with GNU/Linux or Android with iOS or a custom ROM. I'm not saying that Linux is objectively "better" than Windows or that Android is somehow worse than iOS. They're just proven to have better privacy practices.<br><br>
