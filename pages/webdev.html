      <p>
        Truth be told, there's actually written proof that I've wanted to be a programmer since even first or second grade. That's kinda crazy to me, since even now some of my friends don't know what they want to do.<br><br>
        The reason it's surprising that I can get paid for web development is that I've always thought it was nothing like the "serious" C++ programming that I've been doing in school. It's just too fun and creative.<br><br>

      <h1>What are you working on?</h1>

      <p>
        I'm currently working on a redesign for <a href="https://agb.lv" target="_blank">agb.lv</a> and another lower priority project for <a href="https://chalete.lv" target="_blank">chalete.lv</a>. I do have some personal experiments, too. You can find those over at <a href="https://www.labr.it" target="_blank">labr.it</a>.<br><br>

      <h1>What can you do?</h1>
      <div class="separator"></div>

        Since I learned web developent as a hobby at first, I'm most comfortable with basic HTML, CSS and JS (and PHP) like the stuff that makes up this exact website. However, I've started learning more and more about the modern stuff.<br><br>
        As of writing this, the only experience I have with JS frameworks and site generators is through Gatsby JS. I've also worked with WordPress a fair bit.
